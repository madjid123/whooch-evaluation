This thesis discusses various methods and issues involved in the generation of physicochemical,
quantum chemical, graph theoretical, descriptors, molecular fingerprint and chemical space
descriptors etc, for in silico molecular design approaches. A futuristic perspective of structural
indices in drug design is outlined. All chemists use models, models are very useful because they
often represent a simple way of describing and predicting scientific results without the work of
performing the complex mathematical manipulations dictated by a rigorous theory.
The main purpose of this thesis was to perform computational investigations on Hydantoin using
ab initio and Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods at an appropriate high level of theory, in
order to get better insight into the structures and energetic of these compounds. Systematic
investigations on the dependence of several geometric parameters of Hydantoin on the level of
theory used led to the outcome that optimizations with best method DFT B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p),
6-31G++(d,p), 6-311G++(d,p) than ab initio /HF /6-31G+(d,p), 6-31G++(d,p) , 6-311G++(d,p)
model chemistries yield a resulting geometry which is in excellent agreement with the
experimental findings. We are interested in this work a computational study of the Hydantoin
and Hydantoins.
In this thesis, molecular modeling approach was used to study the structural, vibrational and
electronic nucleus of Hydantoin to present the most stable molecular conformation and also
define the best method as the basis for study the chemical reactivity of this last. The study of the
reactivity of the Hydantoin directly related to the study of their substitution. A qualitative study
on the relationship structure-properties of a bioactive series of Hydantoin was carried out.
