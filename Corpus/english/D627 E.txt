This work is a contribution to the study of the content of the total phenolic content and
antioxidant activity of ten varieties of dark-purple eggplantâ€™s grown in ten different regions of
eastern Algeria. The methods used are the Folin-Ciocalteu assay to quantify total phenolic
content, the DPPH test and the electrochemical method using the voltammetry technique were
used for measuring the antioxidant activity, the results were very significant. The correlation
between the antioxidant activity and the content of total phenolic compounds was also
investigated. This combination allowed us to make a quantitative and qualitative assessment
of phenolic compounds extracted from samples of eggplant studied. The results assert that the
extracts of peel have a very high antioxidant capacity relatively to the whole fruit and pulp.
The effect of freezing and drying was studied and developed two varieties of eggplant
in the El-Oued, which are the dark-purple and the white variety. Extracts of dark-purple
variety were the most active extracts and show an interesting contribution to antioxidant
activity.
The results of this work allowed us to confirm that the antioxidant capacity of eggplant
is essentially caused by the phenolic compounds.
