This study highlights the role of public expenditure rationalization in treating public
budget deficit in Islamic economics, at time when there is an increasing interest from the
specialists about the problem of public financial deficit, and government expenditure
rationalization, due to the massive decrease of the public revenues, and by consequence, big
deficits in their public budgets, and with the big efforts exerted by governments to solve this
problem. The cause behind this problem is the increasing responsabilities of the governments,
and their needs to face the normal increase of citizens, and the need to offer health and
educational services to them, and the increase in Military Expenditures, so the rationalization
of general spending becomes a necessity
For reaching this objective, the study has been devided has been into five chapters ,
where the first chapter addressed the most important basic concepts related to public
expenditure in the Islamic economy in terms of its concept and its elements and subdivisions ,
and the public need , and thus access to the goals of public expenditure and raised in Islamic
Economics. The second chapter we attempted to see the structure of adequate financial
resources to cover public expenditure in the modern state which adopts Islamic approach in
all its affairs, from the adoption of the division of public revenues in accordance with the
standard cyclical redundancy that on the basis of which is divided into public revenues to:
public periodic revenues such as : alzakah, alkharaj.. , and public non-periodical revenues;
such as Tawdhif and public loans .. .The third chapter studied the state budget in Islamic
economics , by studying the origins and the extent of its presence at the thought of Islamic
finance , and then bring the perception about the public budget of modern state which adopts
the Islamic approach, while the fourth chapter addressed of financial deficit of government
and the reasons for its occurrence , and the traditional methods of financing and discussed in
terms of economic, and legal context, then the different methods to finance the deficit from
an Islamic point of view. The last chapter treated the idea of public expenditure rationalization
as a policy of Islamic economics , and the concordance between this policy and that of
reducing public expenditure, and the extent to match the idea of the rationalization of public
spending in Islamic economics with the idea of the rationalization of public expenditure in the
traditional economics , and the extent of the reliability of the process of rationalization of
public expenditure in Islamic economics ; basis for treatment integrated approach to the
budget deficit , through studying the correlation between budget division evolution, and
public expenditure rationalization evolution, by many stages.
The study included that the zero-based budget can be considered as public expenditure
rationalization requirements, which contributes in solving the deficit, with compatibility with
Shariaa principles, and the rules of rationalization of public expenditure in Islamic doctrines,
especially the rule of priorities, and income-cost analysis, and maximization of social benefit
function, also insistence of the Muslim scholars to make feasibility studies from a social
perspective to all projects that will be expend by state, in order to show the negative impacts
of the squandering in public expenditure, as itâ€™s shown by Iben Khaldoun, Al Makriziz, Al
Assadi, and others .
