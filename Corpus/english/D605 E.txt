We propose a formal approach for development of safe web applications. This approach involves
the generation of a web application on both sides (usersâ€™ side (Ajax) and the web service side
(Composition)) from formal specifications. First, we describe the application using symbolic notations
(CTT), then an automatic process is applied in order to translate them into formal specifications B.
Using the B refinement process, a set of refinement rules, operating on data and operations. These
phases of refinement are intended to make the final specifications close to the implementation
language chosen so that the last coding phase becomes intuitive and natural. In general, the process of
refinement is a manual task, relatively expensive; with character generic of these refinement rules, an
assisted refinement tool can be achieved, enabling reduction the cost of the refining process. Finally,
in the case study, we have developed a complete application (Travel Agency) in order to show the
benefits of our approach.
