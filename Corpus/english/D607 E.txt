The issue of capital adequacy in banks has gained great importance in the light of the
global censorship changes, particularly in recent years as a result of the increasing risk as well
as the financial crises they face, The interest of industrial countries on the issue of capital
adequacy and the need to unify the control systems on them have been significantly increased,
therefore those countries have imposed their own standards (Basel 3 ), where the latter came
in an attempt to strengthen global capital and the rules of liquidity for the ability to achieve a
more flexible and stability of the banking sector, as well as to avoid risks and to avoid
transport, therefore they have introduced the safety margins and financial leverage rates, and
introduced indicators for liquidity risk management in order to provide banks with a high
quality of capital during pressure and crises periods.
 Under the influence of these circumstances, it was imperative for the Islamic banks to
apply these new decisions (Basel 3) because it is part of the global banking system, where
they also are interested in international banking claims imposed on the various banks and
financial institutions that compose global banking system, However, these banks face special
difficulties in how to implement this agreement, which is primarily due to the fact that the
latter came in to suit the traditional banking business and not the nature of the Islamic
banking, and this is why the various structures charged with the development of Islamic
banking business on top of them the Islamic Financial Services Board, in order to make great
efforts to find a standard based on the Basel Convention 3 through which it is possible to
measure the capital adequacy of Islamic banks at the same time be consistent and to suit the
nature of the latter, that increases and enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the
censorship system, thereby increasing the confidence and credibility in their work supporting
of its march and its role in society.
 In this sense this study comes in an attempt to clarify all what is brought by this
agreement (Basel 3) on the banking capital adequacy and the standard emanating issued by
the Council of the Islamic Financial Services. In order to demonstrate the relationship
between risk financing methods and investment in Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and the capital
adequacy standard issued by the Islamic Financial Services Board according to Basel 3.
