Capital markets play a great importance in the economic life, particularly
in the developed industrial countries, it is considered one of the pillars of the
capitalism system, and through the many functions performed by the stock
exchanges, such as the mobilization of savings, investment allocation ... etc.
As for developing countries, especially the Arab suffered from many
crises, especially debt crisis world, so it drives them to change the methods of
financing there in, by going to foreign direct investment and bond offering in the
international markets and the opening of its financial markets to foreign
investment, and this shift in the flow towards the developing countries and in
with financial globalization appeared the so-called emerging financial markets.
The composition and objectives of capital flows differed over time, where
after what was borrowing from banks is a key component of inflows of foreign
capital ,it has become both foreign direct investment and investment in the
portfolio are the dominant in the composition of capital flows and , it has been
successful especially developing and emerging countries in support economic
development , especially through increasing efficiency and the allocation of
capital , transfer of technology , but they have a lot of negatives which
contribute to the occurrence of many of the financial crises destructive through
flows reverse and sudden to this money , especially on hot money , which affect
both the stock markets and also exchange markets and the best example of this
financial crisis, Southeast Asia, in 1997.
This study has tried to treat the problem of the activity of financial market
(foreign investment in the portfolio) and its effect on the stability of the
exchange rate in Arab countries (the case of Egypt with analytic and
measurement way).we found that there is a mutual effect between the stock
markets and exchange market through the activity or behavior of foreign
investment in portfolio, and this is what shown in the analysis of financial crisis
which happened in south east Asia in 1997.
As for the reality of this investment in Arab stock exchanges flows
remains weak compared with other emerging stock markets and developed
countries, in despite of the reforms undertaken by most of the Arab countries
especially with regard to the side legislative and regulatory oversight of
financial markets, in addition to other economic reforms.
For more in depth study, we studied the Egyptian Stock Exchange
because it is considered one of the oldest financial markets of emerging Arab
and most active, and we found analytically that there is the effect of trading
flows and foreign investment in the financial portfolio in the stock market on the
exchange rate of the Egyptian pound, This result was enhanced by measuring
this effect through the use of multiple regression between each of the exchange
rate of the pound against the dollar in the period (1997-2011) , the most
important determinants agreed with like , average inflation , the degree of
openness to the outside world , the conditions of trade , net inflows of foreign
investment in portfolio of financial , economic growth , foreign reserves and the
study found that all of the variables terms of trade and net flows of foreign
investment in the portfolio, have played an important role in explaining
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound during the period
studied ,but the other variables havenâ€™t got any significant impact on the
exchange rate of the Egyptian pound.
