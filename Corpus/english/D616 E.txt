the foreign direct investment has attracted the attention of various countries of the world in recent years, and was able to make him an important place among other international financing tools that the cost makes burdened debtors, unlike FDI that provides toll-free capital movements.
And following its importance, most of the world is competing to attract FDI, by improving their investment climate, and pass laws that encourage its movement and ensure its protection, and especially adopt economic, financial policies and policies of investment that are integrated, which manage the investment climate in general and FDI in particular.
Our study aims including investment policies, where these vary from one state to another, depending on its attitude of FDI; by encouraging it or limiting its options, and according to the economic nature of the state who want to attract it and the efforts that are made for this reason, and especially depending on the state's ability to control the consequences of its investment policies; the thing that can be achieved by following a principle that these policies must ensure the attraction of FDI to the extent that helps the host country to finance its economy, and at the same time ensuring that this investment does not affect the growth of its economy and its stability, and therein lies the importance of the investment policy. 
And the Arab countries, like all countries around the world, strive to create and improve their investment climate and develop it to meet the demands of foreign investors and affect their decision to choose them as a place to their investments. And our example it is Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which makes the answer to the problem of our study, that revolves around the effectiveness of the investment policy to attract foreign direct investment in these countries.
Comparing between these countries, our study showed that the investment policies approved in Algeria are not enough to attract FDI, there is that which covers their efficiency, which is the modesty of the remaining components of the climate investment in Algeria, particularly infrastructure, wich must be developed and integrated with the rest of the investment climate components.
In addition, the share of Algeria FDI flows are insufficient compared to the opportunities available to them, which proves that efforts by Algeria to create the investment climate are not enough, especially when compared to those made in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that exceed
largely. The thing that is lacking investment policies in Algeria is a directive to serve the local economy, because the fact that the majority of FDI flows are concentrated in the oil sector does not serve the local economic development.
