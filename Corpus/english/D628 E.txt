The research and synthesis of new chemical compounds today is often based on the use of computer science combined with a study by computational chemistry which has become indispensable for the development of new compounds, materials and processes. Thus a new tool has appeared allowing any chemist to better understand the problems linked to the molecular domain: molecular modeling. The theoretical methods used to obtain models allowing to understand the physicochemical properties and the molecular interactions are known under the name of "Molecular Modeling". Molecular modeling is increasingly used today to study chemical reactivity. These methods make it possible to provide additional information to that obtained by experimental methods. Indeed, the first field of application of molecular modeling has historically been that of chemistry. Modeling also offers many opportunities in experimental biology. Thus, molecular modeling makes it possible to obtain, for example, the structure of the transition state of a given chemical reaction, which is difficult, if not impossible, for experimental chemistry. The number of theoretical studies using these techniques, to guide or clarify experimental observations. Research carried out on the basis of scientific data oriented on biology and published by Pubmed on the years 2010â€گ2011, lists more than 1,800 studies. Growing ever faster with power and computing capacity.
Theoretical methods that make it possible to calculate data relating to the structure and properties of a molecule can be subdivided into two categories: molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics (semi-empirical, ab initio and DFT). The comparison of the biological activity of certain molecules and their structures has made it possible in many cases to establish correlations between the structural parameters and the properties of a molecule. The association of variations in biological activity with structural parameters makes it possible to obtain a system of equations which gives, for a given chemical series and for a defined activity, a correlation equation. The essential interest of this equation is that it must make it possible to determine the values â€‹â€‹of the parameters which correspond to a maximum biological activity and to predict the activity of molecules which have not yet been synthesized.
This research work takes place in the context of a fundamental and original quest on two types of molecules, cephalosporins and oxazoles. The main objective of this work is the application of different molecular modeling methods to predict the chemical reactivities and biological activities expected in new bioactive molecules for the two types of molecules studied.
