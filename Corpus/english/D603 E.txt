The huge volume of digital documents available, has become a problem for the
process of interrogation and access to relevant information.
Most of these documents have a structure (physical and logical), but it is
difficult to be identified and used, making painful retrieving relevant parts of
information.
In our case we are interested in the structural-semantic modeling of documents
representation and put them in a readable format to be effectively usable by
information search algorithms.
Our objective in this work is to return the fragment of the most relevant
documents. We model the homogeneous collections of documents, such as scientific
publications, articles and theses in PDF or Word format, and web documents such as
Wikipedia pages in XML format.
