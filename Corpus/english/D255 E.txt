The present research includes fouling related experimental work and the reliability-based statistical analysis of the fouling data.
 In this regard, several replicate experiments related to CaCOâ‚ƒ scaling under identical operating conditions are conducted.
 In addition data is obtained from literature regarding corrosion fouling.
 The fouling curves are drawn as a function of time and corresponding to a critical fouling resistance Rf,c, 
the probability distribution of time 't' to reach this critical level of fouling and some of its associated functions are determined.
 The distribution for time to foul 't' for CaCOâ‚ƒ is found to be inverted normal of خ±-distribution,
 whereas for the case of corrosion it is a modified version of خ±-distribution.
 Thermoeconomic analysis id carried out for a heat-exchanger used in the preheat train of crude oil refining process.
 In this regard, a dimensionless cost function is derived and the influence of vrious parameters
 on the optimum costs and maintenance period have been studied by incorporating a risk factor p.
