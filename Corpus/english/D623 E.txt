The rapid development in banking activity, which is characterized by the
financial liberalization of banking services and the development of their strategies,
has led to the emergence of new entities of banks based on foreign direct investment
in national sectors through different countries around the world, leading to rapid
capital movement and significant integration into capital markets at the world level.
Thus, the entry of foreign banks into the local banking industry can influence the
banking system of the host country, it can also create competition between foreign
banks and local banks within this industry on the one hand, and On the other hand
the entry of these banks may lead the central banks of host countries to prepare a
favourable banking environment for banking activity which is based on financial
liberalization as well as the strengthening of banking control and supervision so as to
maintain the monetary stability of the host country.
The Algerian banking system is an integral part of the global banking system, it

have conducted a number of banking reforms to restructure its banking system and
reorganize the banking function in accordance with international standards in order to
achieve financial liberalization and the opening of this system to the world, these
reforms have opened the investment doors of foreign banks in Algeria.
In this regard, the study deals with the impact of foreign banks on the
performance of the Algerian banking system, it aims to highlight the possibility of
leading and rationalizing foreign banks by the monetary authorities in order to
achieve the objectives of the monetary policy of the state by focusing the research of
this study on the impact of foreign banks on the performance of the Algerian banking
industry, basing on the structure, market and performance paradigm (SCP) for the
establishment of the model of study.
The study, found that the presence of foreign banks in the Algerian banking
market represents a real breakthrough rather than mere presence .i.e. these foreign
banks have a direct and positive impact on the performance of Algeria banks through
the existence of collusion process among the banks that have a high concentration
that are the public banks, this hast a big impact on the profitability of banks in
contrast to the market share of banks, which have no effect on the profitability of
banks.
