Solar adsorption refrigeration systems have been increasingly attracting some research interests since 
last decade because they are clean, cheap and simple for use in air conditioning, ice making, 
food preservation and vaccine storage specially for remote areas. The idea of these devices is the reversible
 physical adsorption of vapor on the surface of a porous solid.
 The system consists of three important components: solar collector with adsorbent bed, condenser and evaporator.
 The main objectives of this work are to improve the performance of the solar intermittent refrigeration system
 that uses activated carbon and methanol as adsorbent and adsorbate pair. 
The improvement of the systemâ€™s performance is achieved through investigating the effect of the main operative
 and constructive parameters of the system. EES and MATLAB computer programs are exploited to analyze 
the thermodynamic cycle of the system and to model the system under Dhahran climate conditions, respectively.
 The results show that the increase in the condenser temperature needs high values of the desorption temperature
 while lowering values of the evaporator temperature needs low values in the adsorption temperature to improve
 the performance. The absorbers of collector should have thin wall and should be coated by high absorptivity
 and low emissivity material. About 14.1 kg/m2 of activated carbon NORIT RX3-Extra per m2 of collector
 surface is a suitable optimum choice for adsorption ice maker devices. Furthermore, double glazing,
 tilt angle of the solar collector and starting the cycle at suitable time as well as suitable collector back
 insulation increase the performance. Moreover, the study proposes an activated carbon/methanol solar
 adsorption ice-maker that could produce from 5 kg up to 13 kg of ice per day per m2 of collector area with improved
 solar coefficients of performance of 0.12 and 0.24 according to weather conditions in the hot and the cold days,
 respectively.
