The strut-and-tie model provides one of the most useful design methods for shear critical concrete structures,
 and it gives a better understanding of the force flow in cracked reinforced concrete members,
 with struts representing the flow of compressive stresses and ties representing the flow of tension stresses.
 Prestressed precast hollow core slabs are used extensively for floors and roofs in precast concrete construction.
 For these prestressed concrete members without web reinforcement, shear can be critical for certain load configurations. 
The strut and tie model provides a tool for predicting the flexural and shear capacity of these slabs. 
This study presents a new strut-and-tie model to predict the ultimate load-carrying capacity of prestressed precast hollow
 core slabs and also to indicate the associated mode of failure. It is important to incorporate concrete tension
 elements (concrete ties) in the truss model to carry the diagonal tension forces in these members.
 An experimental program involving full-scale load-testing of 17 hollow core slabs, 4.7 m and 2.2 m in span and having 
three different depths, 200 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm was conducted by using the four point load test.
 The flexural and shear strength of 17 prestressed precast hollow core (PPHC) slabs with different shear 
span-to-depth (a/d) ratio were investigated experimentally and analytically.
 The results obtained from the proposed strut-and-tie model have been compared with experimental results
 The proposed strut-and-tie model provides good agreement with the experimental results,
 and it can be employed for the analysis and design of hollow core slabs.
