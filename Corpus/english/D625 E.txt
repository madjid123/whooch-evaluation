The significant emerging need for the use of quantitative methods in the administration is a result of the magnitude of modern institutions and projects, where the administrative problems become very complex. Traditional methods that rely on self-resolution expertise, experience, and error are not effective today. Furthermore, the bad estimation of the results of decisions may cause irreparable damages and losses.
 The main determinants are integrated to achieve the project objectives (time and cost), but the difficulty of reconciling them is one of the fundamental dilemmas of projects, it is therefore important to focus the work on the use of scientific methods which allow project accomplishment in short time, and with low cost. The use of quantitative methods in general and network analysis in particular are submitted among techniques that play an effective role in the process  of planning, organizing and supervising the project resources during the achievement and follow up implementation to detect the deviations, and to take necessary measures in a timely manner.
 This study aims to highlight how to use the web analysis in the management of project resources. It focuses on the Critical Path Technology (CPM), and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). These methods had applied on the project of building 60 apartments in Biskra, using the program Win QSB, and MS Project
according to the following steps: 
-Time schedule has been prepared to implement the project as it was reached that the time required for the implementation of the project is estimated at 149 weeks, which is larger than the duration included in the contract, which is estimated at 80 weeks;
-The scheduling of limited human resources, according to the early start, and the late start where they reached the energy utilized in the rescheduling of the unlimited human resources according to the early start had arrived to tell the level of 66 workers, while the unutilized energy according to the late first arrived to the maximum level of 48
workers, and it is the best schedule;
-As the total cost of the human resources of 60 apartments in Biskra was estimated at 32.075.400 DA, which represents 24,91% of the total cost of the project. The scheduling of financial resources according to the early start, and the late start, where agreement was reached that each of the two alternatives (ES) (LS) will ensure the completion of
the project in the estimated time (30/03/2016). So, there is no difference in terms of the impact on the time of the completion of the project, but the only existing difference is the need for funds to implement the project.
-It has been found that one of the reasons is that some managers of projects suffer from lack experience in the field of quantitative methods, and basically how to use them in practice .
