In the present work, the synergistic extraction of three metals copper(II), cobalt(II) and
nickel(II) from sulfate media with capric acid in the presence of synergistic agents tri-noctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and methylisobutylketone (MIBK) into chloroform at 25 آ°C,
has been carried out.
The study of the acid-base behavior capric acid in a biphasic chloroform-water
(Na2SO4) system showed that pKA MIBK > pKA chloroforme > pKA dichloromأ©thane.
The study of the acid- base behavior of the mixture (capric acid-TOPO) and (capric
acid-MIBK) in the chloroform-water (Na2SO4) system revealed the interaction between capric
acid and TOPO on the one hand and capric acid and MIBK on the other.
In the absence of synergistic agent, the extracted species for copper(II), cobalt(II) and
nickel(II) in the organic phase have been found to be CuL22HL, CoL22HL, NiL2 and NiL2HL,
and their extraction equilibrium can be formulated as:
Cu 2 HL CuL (HL) 2H 2,org 2 2, org
ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« logKex = -7,17
 ï€¨ ï€©
2 Co 2 HL CoL (HL) 2H 2,org 2 2, org
ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« logKex = -11,87
 ï€¨ ï€©
2 Ni HL NiL 2H 2,org 2, org
ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« logKex = -14,20
 ï€¨ ï€©
2 Ni 3/ 2 HL NiL 2H 2,org 2 org HL ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€« logKex =-12,81

The presence of the synergistic agent TOPO and MIBK in the system chloroformwater (Na2SO4) at low concentrations showed a synergistic effect. Whereas increasing the
concentration of TOPO and MIBK in the organic phase results a decrease of the extraction
